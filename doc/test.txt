Tips
Tips for Role one: How to start a conversation and keep it going?
	1、No filtering, no checking with yourself  “would I sound cool if I say this?”. It kills the conversation if you care what other people think on you.
	2、Saying “Interesting, tell me more”. People are too focused on how they are coming across. Get it? Easiest way to keep it going is to let the other one talk. If they start talking, your job has already fairly completed.
	     eg: if it is a beautiful name left, saying “Interesting, tell me more about your name”. if guests more than one time, saying “Interesting, tell me more about your first time experience”.
	3、Won’t have enough time to practice this one but if so… Stories from everywhere even it is a fake one. It can be any silly story, short or long, interesting, or totally awkward—just use it!

Tips for Role Two: How to introduce the club?
	Always use club board to input value, lead the conversation and extend your influence
	      Achievement board: you can introduce club DCP program, “what is dcp, what it means to a club”. Table topic contest winner, could say “what is a contest, in what level, what is district, how to master a table topic, etc”.
	      Founding member board: who is the founder, why he created this club, what’ s the club vision, who are these founding members, any stories about them, practice storytelling thing, does not need to be acurate in this part.
	      President boards: what makes them special, pick one or two with whom you have personal stories, what happened in that term when the president rules the club, when do you join the club, why you join it?
	You won’t able able to cover all of them, but bear in mind that what you want the guest gain from you, what is the value&standard the club wants to present. You ll need to use pauses and eye contacts from time to time to check the reaction from the guests, to see if your words has influence either on their behaviour or their understanding towards the club, which will help you to do a better one next time.

Tips for Role Three: How to gain attention in session of call for the order?
	1、Be ready.
	      Invite people to take a seat if anyone stands or just step in the room.
	      Repeat the start of meeting if people are still dealing with other business
	      Need 1-2 second-silence to confirm that you have get the most attention and move on
	2、Greet people in such order: guests、members from other clubs(prefer their club name is announced)、home club members.
	      Spend less than one minute
	3、Notice taboo & mobile disturbance
	      Most likely you ll see people do not take any move toward mobile disturbances, make a pause and reassure their phone silence by having little fun here.
	4、Invite President on the stage.
